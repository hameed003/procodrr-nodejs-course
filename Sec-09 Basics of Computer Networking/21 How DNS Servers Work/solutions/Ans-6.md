Testing DNS changes is crucial to ensure that your domain name resolves correctly and that the changes you made (e.g., updating A, MX, or CNAME records) are working as expected. Below are step-by-step methods to test DNS changes using various tools and techniques.

---

### **1. Using `nslookup`**

`nslookup` is a command-line tool available on Windows, Linux, and macOS to query DNS records.

#### **Steps**:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Query the DNS record you want to test:
   - For an **A record**:
     ```bash
     nslookup example.com
     ```
   - For an **MX record**:
     ```bash
     nslookup -query=MX example.com
     ```
   - For a **CNAME record**:
     ```bash
     nslookup -query=CNAME www.example.com
     ```
3. Check the output to verify the DNS record:
   - Ensure the returned IP address or domain name matches your expected changes.

#### **Example**:

```bash
nslookup example.com
```

**Output**:

```
Name:    example.com
Address: 93.184.216.34
```

### **2. Using `dig`**

`dig` (Domain Information Groper) is a powerful command-line tool for querying DNS records, commonly used on Linux and macOS.

#### **Steps**:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Query the DNS record you want to test:
   - For an **A record**:
     ```bash
     dig example.com A
     ```
   - For an **MX record**:
     ```bash
     dig example.com MX
     ```
   - For a **CNAME record**:
     ```bash
     dig www.example.com CNAME
     ```
3. Check the **ANSWER SECTION** in the output to verify the DNS record.

#### **Example**:

```bash
dig example.com A
```

**Output**:

```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
example.com.    3600    IN    A    93.184.216.34
```

### **3. Using Online DNS Tools**

Online DNS tools provide a user-friendly way to test DNS changes without using the command line.

#### **Popular Tools**:

- **DNS Checker**: https://dnschecker.org/
- **MX Toolbox**: https://mxtoolbox.com/
- **WhatsMyDNS**: https://www.whatsmydns.net/

#### **Steps**:

1. Visit one of the online DNS tools.
2. Enter the domain name and select the record type (e.g., A, MX, CNAME).
3. Click **Search** or **Check**.
4. Verify the results to ensure they match your expected changes.

#### **Example**:

- Go to https://dnschecker.org/.
- Enter `example.com` and select **A Record**.
- Check the returned IP address.

---

### **4. Using `ping`**

`ping` can be used to test if a domain resolves to the correct IP address.

#### **Steps**:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Ping the domain:
   ```bash
   ping example.com
   ```
3. Check the IP address in the output:
   - Ensure it matches the expected IP address.

#### **Example**:

```bash
ping example.com
```

**Output**:

```
Pinging example.com [93.184.216.34] with 32 bytes of data:
```

### **5. Using `host`**

`host` is a simple command-line tool for DNS lookups, available on Linux and macOS.

#### **Steps**:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Query the DNS record:
   - For an **A record**:
     ```bash
     host example.com
     ```
   - For an **MX record**:
     ```bash
     host -t MX example.com
     ```
   - For a **CNAME record**:
     ```bash
     host -t CNAME www.example.com
     ```
3. Check the output to verify the DNS record.

#### **Example**:

```bash
host example.com
```

**Output**:

```
example.com has address 93.184.216.34
```

### **6. Testing DNS Propagation**

DNS changes may take time to propagate globally due to DNS caching. To test DNS propagation:

#### **Steps**:

1. Use an online DNS propagation tool like **WhatsMyDNS** (https://www.whatsmydns.net/).
2. Enter your domain name and select the record type (e.g., A, MX, CNAME).
3. Check the results from multiple locations worldwide to ensure the changes have propagated.

#### **Example**:

- Go to https://www.whatsmydns.net/.
- Enter `example.com` and select **A Record**.
- Check the IP address returned from different locations.

### **7. Clearing DNS Cache**

If youâ€™re testing DNS changes on your local machine, you may need to clear the DNS cache to see the updated results.

#### **Windows**:

1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   ipconfig /flushdns
   ```

#### **macOS**:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
   ```

#### **Linux**:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the following command (if using `systemd-resolved`):
   ```bash
   sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
   ```

### **8. Testing Email (MX Records)**

To test MX records for email delivery:

#### **Steps**:

1. Use an online MX lookup tool like **MX Toolbox** (https://mxtoolbox.com/).
2. Enter your domain name and click **MX Lookup**.
3. Verify the returned mail servers match your expected configuration.

#### **Example**:

- Go to https://mxtoolbox.com/.
- Enter `example.com` and click **MX Lookup**.
- Check the returned mail servers (e.g., `mail.example.com`).

### **9. Testing Reverse DNS (PTR Records)**

To test reverse DNS (PTR) records:

#### **Steps**:

1. Use the `dig` or `nslookup` command:
   - For `dig`:
     ```bash
     dig -x 93.184.216.34
     ```
   - For `nslookup`:
     ```bash
     nslookup 93.184.216.34
     ```
2. Verify the returned domain name matches your expected configuration.

#### **Example**:

```bash
dig -x 93.184.216.34
```

**Output**:

```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
34.216.184.93.in-addr.arpa.    IN    PTR    example.com.
```

### **Conclusion**

Testing DNS changes ensures that your domain resolves correctly and that your updates (e.g., A, MX, CNAME records) are functioning as expected. By using tools like `nslookup`, `dig`, online DNS checkers, and clearing your DNS cache, you can verify DNS changes and troubleshoot any issues effectively.
