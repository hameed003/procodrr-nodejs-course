Great question! Let's break it down simply:

---

### üñ•Ô∏è **What is MS-DOS?**

**MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System)** was a **text-based operating system** before Windows.

* Released in 1981.
* You had to **type commands** (no mouse, no GUI).
* Example command:

  ```bash
  dir /w
  ```

### ü™ü **Why are we still using backslash `\` in Windows paths today?**

Even though modern **Windows is GUI-based**, it was **built on top of MS-DOS** for many years (until Windows XP). So:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Older software expected `\`, so Windows kept it.
2. **Consistency**: Changing it now would break lots of existing code and tools.

---

### ‚úÖ But Windows now also **accepts `/` in many places**:

For example, in most **modern languages** or **PowerShell**, you can use:

```bash
C:/Users/Ahmad
```

So while `\` is the **default**, Windows is now **more flexible**.
