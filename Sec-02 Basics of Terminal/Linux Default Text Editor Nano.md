The **GNU nano** editor is a simple, user-friendly text editor commonly found on Linux and Unix-based systems. It is designed to be easy to use, especially for beginners, while still offering essential features for text editing. Unlike Vim, nano operates in a single mode, making it more intuitive for users who are not familiar with modal editing.

### **Advanced Features**

#### Syntax Highlighting

Nano supports syntax highlighting for various programming languages. To enable it:

1. Install the syntax highlighting package (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nano-syntax-highlighting
   ```
2. Add the following line to your `~/.nanorc` file:
   ```bash
   include "/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc"
   ```
3. Open a file with a supported extension (e.g., `.py`, `.sh`), and nano will automatically apply syntax highlighting.

#### Configuration

You can customize nano by editing the `~/.nanorc` file. Here are some common settings:

```bash
# Enable line numbers
set linenumbers

# Enable mouse support
set mouse

# Set tab size to 4 spaces
set tabsize 4

# Convert tabs to spaces
set tabstospaces

# Enable auto-indentation
set autoindent
```

#### Multiple Buffers

Nano allows you to work with multiple files simultaneously:

- Open multiple files:
  ```bash
  nano file1.txt file2.txt
  ```
- Switch between buffers:
  - `^X` (Ctrl + X) to close the current buffer.
  - `^R` (Ctrl + R) to open another file in a new buffer.

   ```

2. Add the following code:

   python3 script.py
   ```
