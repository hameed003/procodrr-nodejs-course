### **üîç Analysis of Your WAN Configuration**

Your **WAN IP (`172.16.172.211`)** is a **private IP address**, which means your ISP is using **CG-NAT (Carrier-Grade NAT)**. This is why you **cannot ping your public IP (`206.84.236.32`)** or access your router from the internet.

### **üìå What Your WAN Configuration Means**

| Parameter           | Value                              | Explanation                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WAN IP Address**  | `172.16.172.211`                   | üö® **Private IP** (from `172.16.0.0/12` range) ‚Üí Means you're behind **CG-NAT** |
| **Subnet Mask**     | `255.255.255.255`                  | Your device is assigned a single IP address                                     |
| **Default Gateway** | `172.16.128.1`                     | The **ISP's internal router** that connects you to the internet                 |
| **DNS Servers**     | `103.88.220.245`, `103.88.221.245` | Public DNS servers used for domain resolution                                   |

### **üîπ Why Can‚Äôt You Ping `206.84.236.32`?**

Your **public IP (`206.84.236.32`) is shared by multiple customers** using CG-NAT. Since your router is actually assigned a **private IP (`172.16.172.211`)**, it does not directly receive ICMP (ping) requests from the internet.

When you **"What is my IP?"**, it shows `206.84.236.32` because **this is the public IP of your ISP‚Äôs CG-NAT gateway** (not your router).

---

## **üîπ What is CG-NAT and How Does it Work?**

CG-NAT (Carrier-Grade NAT) is a technique ISPs use to **assign a single public IP to multiple customers** by translating private IPs to a shared public IP.

### **üöÄ Example of How CG-NAT Works (Your Case)**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ You Make a Request to a Website**

- Your router **(172.16.172.211)** sends a request to **Google (`8.8.8.8`)**.
- The ISP‚Äôs CG-NAT gateway (public IP **206.84.236.32**) translates your private IP to this public IP and forwards the request.
- Google **sees the request as coming from `206.84.236.32`**, not `172.16.172.211`.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Google Responds**

- Google replies to **206.84.236.32** (your ISP's public IP).
- CG-NAT translates the response and forwards it to **your private IP (`172.16.172.211`)**.
- You receive the webpage data on your device.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Someone Tries to Ping `206.84.236.32`**

- The ping reaches the **CG-NAT gateway** (`206.84.236.32`).
- The **ISP blocks or does not know where to forward the request** because **many users share this IP**.
- The ping fails (no response).

### **üìå Key Issues with CG-NAT**

| Problem                        | Explanation                                                       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚ùå Cannot host a server        | Your private IP is **not directly accessible from the internet**  |
| ‚ùå Cannot receive pings        | The **ISP‚Äôs NAT gateway** does not forward ICMP requests          |
| ‚ùå Issues with port forwarding | Port forwarding won‚Äôt work because the ISP controls the public IP |

### **üîπ How to Get a Public IP?**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Ask Your ISP for a Static Public IP**

- Some ISPs offer **dedicated public IPv4 addresses** for an extra fee.
- If they provide one, your WAN IP should change from **172.16.x.x** to a **real public IP** (e.g., `206.x.x.x`).

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Use a VPN or Cloud-Based Solution**

- Services like **Cloudflare Tunnel, Ngrok, or Tailscale** can expose your local services to the internet without needing a public IP.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Switch to IPv6**

- Some ISPs offer **native IPv6** without CG-NAT. If they do, you can host services without issues.

---

### **üîπ Final Conclusion**

- üö® **Your ISP is using CG-NAT**, which means your router has a **private IP (`172.16.172.211`)**, and you **do not have a true public IP**.
- üî¥ **You cannot ping `206.84.236.32` because it belongs to your ISP‚Äôs NAT gateway, not directly to you.**
- ‚úÖ **Solution:** Contact your ISP for a public IP or use a tunneling service like **Cloudflare Tunnel or Ngrok** to expose your local services.
