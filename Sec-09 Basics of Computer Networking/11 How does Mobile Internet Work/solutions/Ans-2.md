In this context, **"carrier"** refers to your **mobile network provider** (also called a **cellular network operator** or **telecom company**). It is the company that provides mobile internet and phone services.

### **Examples of Mobile Carriers:**

- **India**: Jio, Airtel, Vi (Vodafone Idea), BSNL
- **USA**: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile
- **UK**: EE, Vodafone, O2
- **Other regions**: China Mobile, Orange, Telstra, etc.

### **How Does a Mobile Carrier Assign an IPv6 Address?**

1. When your friend's phone connects to the mobile network, the **carrier assigns an IPv6 address** to it.
2. If the phone enables **hotspot (tethering)**, the carrier **assigns a range of IPv6 addresses** to connected devices (like your phone).
3. Your phone gets a **public IPv6 address** from that range, making it reachable over the internet.

So, when I said **"carrier-assigned IPv6 address,"** I meant an **IPv6 address that is provided by the mobile network provider** (e.g., Jio, Airtel, etc.) when your phone connects to the internet via mobile data.
