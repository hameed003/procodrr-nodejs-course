  ```

---

### **3. Version Control Systems**
Version control systems are essential for managing code changes and collaboration.

#### **a. `git`**
`git` is a distributed version control system.

- **Clone a repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
  ```

  ```

- **Pull changes from a remote repository:**
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

---

### **4. Debugging Tools**
Debugging tools help identify and fix issues in code.

#### **a. `gdb` (GNU Debugger)**
`gdb` is used to debug C and C++ programs.

- **Compile a program with debugging information:**
  ```bash
  gcc -g -o program program.c
  ```

- **Start debugging:**
  ```bash
  gdb ./program
  ```

- **Set a breakpoint:**
  ```bash
  break main
  ```

- **Run the program:**
  ```bash
  run
  ```

  ```bash
  next
  ```

- **Print variable values:**
  ```bash
  print variable_name
  ```

---

#### **b. `strace`**
`strace` is used to trace system calls and signals.

- **Trace system calls of a program:**
  ```bash
  strace ./program
  ```

---

### **5. Build Automation Tools**
Build automation tools help automate the compilation and deployment process.

#### **a. `make`**
`make` is used to automate the build process using a `Makefile`.

- **Create a `Makefile`:**
  ```Makefile
  program: program.c
      gcc -o program program.c
  ```

- **Build the program:**
  ```bash
  make
  ```

---

#### **b. `cmake`**
`cmake` is a cross-platform build system generator.

- **Generate build files:**
  ```bash
  cmake .
  ```

- **Build the project:**
  ```bash
  make
  ```

---

### **6. Scripting Commands**
Scripting commands are used to write and execute shell scripts.

#### **a. `bash`**
`bash` is the most commonly used shell for scripting.

- **Create a shell script:**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Hello, World!"
  ```
