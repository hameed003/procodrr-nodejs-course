Sure! Here's a simple detailed explanation of **executable files** and their types:

---

## ðŸ”¹ What is an Executable File?

An **executable file** is a file that **runs a program or script** when opened. It contains instructions the system can **execute directly or via an interpreter**.

---

## ðŸ§  **Types of Executable Files** (with examples):

---

### 1. **Binary Executables (Compiled)**

* Created using languages like **C, C++, Go**
* Compiled into machine code
* Run directly by the OS

#### ðŸ“„ Example:

```bash
./a.out      # Linux (compiled C program)
notepad.exe  # Windows executable
cmd.exe  # Windows executable
chrome.exe  # Windows executable
```

#### âœ… Usage:

```bash
gcc hello.c  # Compiles to a.out (Linux)
```
- We can `run` or `execute` any binary executable file from the `bash terminal` by just pasting the absolute path of the executable file in the bash terminal like below:

```bash
"C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe"
```
- We can also `run` or `execute` any binary executable file form the powershell we just have use `&` before absolute path of the executable file like below:

```bash
& "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe"
```

---

## 2. **Script-Based Executables Files (Interpreted)**

- Written in **Bash, Python, JavaScript, .txt or any other extension etc.**
- We can make any file a executable file in Script-Based Executables
- Need an interpreter to run

#### ðŸ“„ Examples:

| Language | File        | Run Command                       |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| Bash     | `script.sh` | `bash script.sh` or `./script.sh` |
| Python   | `app.py`    | `python app.py`                   |
| Node.js  | `server.js` | `node server.js`                  |

ðŸ’¡ Make script executable:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

Here's a neat example using your filenames and commands:

---

### ðŸ§¾ 1. `ad.sh` (Bash Script)

```bash
# ad.sh
pwd
```

**Usage**:

```bash
chmod +x ad.sh  
./ad.sh  
```

---

### ðŸ§¾ 2. `hello.txt` (Script in .txt)

```bash
# hello.txt
ls
```

**Usage** (Linux):

```bash
chmod +x hello.txt  
./hello.txt  
```

âœ… Even with `.txt`, it runs if it has executable permissions and valid code.

---

### ðŸ§¾ 3. `index.html` (Just contains code, not executable but we are just testing)

```html
<!-- index.html -->
whoami
node --version 
npm --version  
```

**Usage** (Linux):

```bash
chmod +x index.html
./index.html 
```
- it tells the **current username**.
- shows Node.js version
- shows npm version

**NOTE:** We can not run any `script executable files` in powershell, it only runs `.bat` files 

**Example:**
```bash
./hello.txt 
```
- powershell will simply open it in default text editor like notepad.

---


### 3. **.exe, .bat, .msi (Windows Specific)**

* `.exe`: compiled executable
* `.bat`: batch script
* `.msi`: installer package

---

### ðŸ§ª How to Check if File is Executable

```bash
ls -l file
```

If it has `x` permission, it's executable:

```
-rwxr-xr-x  file
```
