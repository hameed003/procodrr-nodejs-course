### **Common Errors and Solutions**

1. **File or Directory Not Found**:

   - Ensure the file or directory name and path are correct.
   - Example:
     ```
     rm nonExistentFile.txt
     ```
     Error: `rm: cannot remove 'nonExistentFile.txt': No such file or directory`

2. **Permission Denied**:

   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete the file or directory.
   - Example:
     ```
     rm /root/file.txt
     ```
     Error: `rm: cannot remove '/root/file.txt': Permission denied`

3. **Directory Not Empty**:

   - Use the `-r` option to delete directories and their contents.
   - Example:
     ```
     rm Documents
     ```
     Error: `rm: cannot remove 'Documents': Is a directory`
     Solution:
     ```
     rm -r Documents
     ```

4. **Invalid File or Directory Name**:
   - Ensure the file or directory name does not contain invalid characters (`/`, `\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`).
   - Example:
     ```
     rm invalid/file.txt
     ```
     Error: `rm: cannot remove 'invalid/file.txt': No such file or directory`
