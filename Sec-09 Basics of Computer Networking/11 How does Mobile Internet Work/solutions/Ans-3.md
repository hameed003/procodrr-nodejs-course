Not exactly. Let me clarify the flow of your request and response in a **mobile hotspot scenario** with **IPv6**.

## **Does the Request Go Through My Friend’s Phone?**

✅ **Yes, but only as a bridge** (not as a processing device).

Here’s what happens when you make a request:

1. Your phone (server) has a **public IPv6 address** assigned by the mobile carrier.
2. When you send a request (e.g., visiting `https://example.com`):
   - The packet **first goes to your friend's phone** because it's acting as your **Wi-Fi access point (hotspot)**.
   - **Your friend’s phone does not modify the request**; it simply **forwards the packet** to the **mobile carrier’s network** (like a router).
   - The mobile carrier **routes the request directly to the destination** (example.com).

### **Does the Response Come Directly to My Phone?**

✅ **Yes, it comes directly to your phone (via the carrier network).**

Here’s how the response returns:

1. The example.com server sees your public IPv6 (`2001:db8:abcd:1234::100`).
2. It sends a response **directly to that IPv6 address** (which belongs to your phone).
3. The response packet follows the **same path in reverse**:
   - The **mobile carrier** routes the response back to your phone.
   - The **hotspot (friend’s phone) simply passes the packet to your phone** (like a router).
   - Your phone **receives and processes the response**.

## **Key Takeaways**

- **Your friend’s phone acts as a Wi-Fi bridge** but **does not process or modify internet traffic**.
- **The mobile carrier handles all actual internet routing**.
- **Your IPv6 address is public**, so responses come **directly to your phone** without NAT.
