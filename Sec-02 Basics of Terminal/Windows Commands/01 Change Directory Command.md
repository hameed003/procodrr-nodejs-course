The `cd` (Change Directory) command in Windows is used to navigate between directories (folders) in the Command Prompt (CMD). Below is a detailed explanation of the `cd` command with examples:

---

### **Basic Syntax**

```
cd [path]
```

- `path`: The directory path you want to navigate to.

---

### **Key Features of `cd` Command**

1. **Move to a Specific Directory**:

   - Use the full path to navigate directly to a folder.
   - Example:
     ```
     cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents
     ```

2. **Move to a Subdirectory**:

   - Use the folder name to move into a subdirectory of the current directory.
   - Example:
     ```
     cd FolderName
     ```

3. **Move Up One Directory Level**:

   - Use `..` to move up one level in the directory hierarchy.
   - Example:
     ```
     cd ..
     ```

4. **Move to the Root Directory**:

   - Use `\` to move to the root directory of the current drive.
   - Example:
     ```
     cd \
     ```

5. **Switch Drives**:

   - To switch to another drive (e.g., from `C:` to `D:`), type the drive letter followed by a colon (`:`).
   - Example:
     ```
     D:
     ```

6. **Move to a Directory in Another Drive**:
   - Use `/d` to change the current drive and directory simultaneously.
   - Example:
     ```
     cd /d D:\Projects
     ```

### **Examples of `cd` Command**

#### 1. **Move to a Specific Directory**

- Navigate to `C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop`:
  ```
  cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop
  ```

#### 2. **Move to a Subdirectory**

- If you're in `C:\Users\YourUsername`, and you want to move to `Documents`:
  ```
  cd Documents
  ```

#### 3. **Move Up One Directory Level**

- If you're in `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents`, and you want to move back to `C:\Users\YourUsername`:
  ```
  cd ..
  ```

#### 4. **Move to the Root Directory**

- If you're in `C:\Users\YourUsername\Documents`, and you want to move to the root of the `C:` drive:
  ```
  cd \
  ```

#### 5. **Switch Drives**

- If you're in `C:\Users\YourUsername`, and you want to switch to the `D:` drive:
  ```
  D:
  ```

#### 6. **Move to a Directory in Another Drive**

- If you're in `C:\Users\YourUsername`, and you want to move to `D:\Projects`:
  ```
  cd /d D:\Projects
  ```

#### 7. **Move to a Directory with Spaces in the Name**

- If the directory name has spaces, enclose the path in double quotes (`"`).
- Example:
  ```
  cd "C:\Users\YourUsername\My Documents"
  ```

#### 8. **Move to the Previous Directory**

- Use `cd -` to return to the previous directory you were in.
- Example:
  ```
  cd -
  ```

### **Common Errors and Solutions**

1. **Directory Not Found**:

   - Ensure the path is correct and the directory exists.
   - Example:
     ```
     cd C:\NonExistentFolder
     ```
     Error: `The system cannot find the path specified.`

2. **Spaces in Directory Names**:

   - Always enclose paths with spaces in double quotes.
   - Example:
     ```
     cd "C:\Program Files"
     ```

3. **Switching Drives Without `/d`**:
   - If you try to `cd` to a directory on another drive without `/d`, the drive won't change.
   - Example:
     ```
     cd D:\Projects
     ```
     This will not switch to the `D:` drive. Use:
     ```
     cd /d D:\Projects
     ```
