In Windows, you can copy and move files using the **`copy`** and **`move`** commands in the Command Prompt (CMD). Below is a detailed explanation of these commands with examples:

---

### **1. Copy Files Using `copy` Command**

The `copy` command is used to copy files from one location to another.

#### **Syntax**

```
copy [source] [destination]
```

---

#### **Examples of `copy`**

1. **Copy a Single File**:

   - Copy a file named `file.txt` from the current directory to `C:\Backup`:
     ```
     copy file.txt C:\Backup
     ```

2. **Copy a File with Spaces in the Name**:

   - Copy a file named `my file.txt` to `C:\Backup`:
     ```
     copy "my file.txt" C:\Backup
     ```

3. **Copy a File to Another Directory with a New Name**:

   - Copy `file.txt` to `C:\Backup` and rename it to `backup.txt`:
     ```
     copy file.txt C:\Backup\backup.txt
     ```

4. **Copy Multiple Files**:

   - Copy all `.txt` files from the current directory to `C:\Backup`:
     ```
     copy *.txt C:\Backup
     ```

5. **Copy All Files from a Directory**:

   - Copy all files from `C:\Source` to `C:\Backup`:
     ```
     copy C:\Source\*.* C:\Backup
     ```

6. **Copy a File to the Current Directory**:

   - Copy `file.txt` from `C:\Source` to the current directory:
     ```
     copy C:\Source\file.txt .
     ```

7. **Copy a File with Confirmation Prompt**:
   - Copy `file.txt` to `C:\Backup` and prompt for confirmation if the file already exists:
     ```
     copy file.txt C:\Backup /y
     ```

     ```

### **Common Errors and Solutions**

1. **File or Directory Not Found**:

   - Ensure the source file or directory and path are correct.
   - Example:
     ```
     copy nonExistentFile.txt C:\Backup
     ```
     Error: `The system cannot find the file specified.`

2. **Permission Denied**:

   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to copy or move the file or directory.
   - Example:
     ```
     copy C:\Windows\system32\file.txt C:\Backup
     ```
     Error: `Access is denied.`

3. **Invalid File or Directory Name**:

   - Ensure the file or directory name does not contain invalid characters (`\`, `/`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`).
   - Example:
     ```
     copy file.txt invalid/path/file.txt
     ```
     Error: `The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.`

4. **Destination File Already Exists**:
   - Use the `/y` option to overwrite the destination file without prompting.
   - Example:
     ```
     copy file.txt C:\Backup /y
     ```
