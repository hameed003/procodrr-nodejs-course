Many devices support **at least up to Layer 4 (Transport Layer)** or higher of the OSI model, depending on their functionality and role in the network. These devices are designed to handle complex tasks like routing, data transfer, and application-level processing. Below is a list of such devices, along with explanations of how they utilize the OSI model layers.

  - **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Filters traffic based on ports (e.g., blocking port 22 for SSH).
  - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Advanced firewalls can inspect application-layer data (e.g., blocking specific websites or malware).
- **Examples**: Cisco ASA, Palo Alto firewalls.

#### **3. Load Balancers**

- **Description**: Load balancers distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
- **Layers Supported**: Up to Layer 4 (some support Layer 7 for application-aware load balancing).
- **How They Use Layers**:

  - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Advanced load balancers can make decisions based on application-layer data (e.g., HTTP headers).
- **Examples**: F5 BIG-IP, NGINX, AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

#### **4. Network Attached Storage (NAS) Devices**

- **Description**: NAS devices are storage systems connected to a network that allow multiple users to access and share files.
- **Layers Supported**: Up to Layer 7.
- **How They Use Layers**:
  - **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Uses TCP for reliable file transfers.
  - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Supports protocols like SMB (Server Message Block) and NFS (Network File System) for file sharing.
- **Examples**: Synology NAS, QNAP NAS.

---

#### **5. VoIP Phones**

- **Description**: VoIP (Voice over IP) phones use the internet to make voice calls instead of traditional phone lines.
- **Layers Supported**: Up to Layer 7.
- **How They Use Layers**:
  - **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Uses UDP for real-time voice data transmission.
  - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Uses protocols like SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) for call setup and control.
- **Examples**: Cisco IP phones, Yealink phones.

---

#### **6. Smart TVs and Streaming Devices**

- **Description**: These devices stream video and audio content over the internet.
- **Layers Supported**: Up to Layer 7.
- **How They Use Layers**:
  - **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Uses TCP for control data and UDP for streaming media.
  - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Uses protocols like HTTP/HTTPS for streaming (e.g., Netflix, YouTube).
- **Examples**: Roku, Apple TV, Smart TVs.

---

#### **7. Print Servers**

- **Description**: Print servers manage print jobs and allow multiple users to share a printer over a network.
- **Layers Supported**: Up to Layer 7.
- **How They Use Layers**:
  - **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Uses TCP for reliable print job transmission.
  - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Supports protocols like IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) and LPD (Line Printer Daemon).
- **Examples**: Dedicated print servers, network-enabled printers.

---

#### **8. IoT Devices (Advanced)**

- **Description**: Advanced IoT (Internet of Things) devices, such as smart home hubs, often support higher layers for communication and control.
- **Layers Supported**: Up to Layer 7.
- **How They Use Layers**:
  - **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Uses TCP/UDP for data transmission.
  - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Uses protocols like MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) or HTTP/HTTPS for communication.
- **Examples**: Amazon Echo, Google Nest Hub.

---

#### **9. VPN Gateways**

- **Description**: VPN (Virtual Private Network) gateways create secure connections between remote users and a private network.
- **Layers Supported**: Up to Layer 4.
- **How They Use Layers**:
  - **Layer 3 (Network Layer)**: Encapsulates data using IPsec or other tunneling protocols.
  - **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Uses TCP/UDP for secure data transmission.
- **Examples**: Cisco VPN Gateway, OpenVPN.

---

#### **10. Unified Threat Management (UTM) Devices**

- **Description**: UTM devices combine multiple security features, such as firewalls, intrusion detection, and antivirus, into a single device.
- **Layers Supported**: Up to Layer 7.
- **How They Use Layers**:
  - **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Filters traffic based on ports and protocols.
  - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Inspects application-layer data for threats.
- **Examples**: Fortinet FortiGate, Sophos UTM.
