The **decimal number system**, also known as the **base-10 number system**, is the most widely used numeral system in the world. It uses ten distinct digits: **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9**. The decimal system is a positional number system, meaning the value of each digit depends on its position in the number.

### Key Features of the Decimal Number System:

1. **Base-10 System**: Each digit represents a power of 10.
2. **Digits**: Only digits from 0 to 9 are used.
3. **Positional Value**: The value of each digit is determined by its position, starting from the right (least significant digit) to the left (most significant digit).
4. **Universal Use**: The decimal system is the standard system for representing numbers in everyday life.

### How the Decimal System Works:

In the decimal system, each digit represents a power of 10. The rightmost digit is $10^0$, the next digit to the left is $10^1$, then $10^2$, and so on.

For example:

- The decimal number $253\_{10}$ can be expanded as:

$$
2 \times 10^2 + 5 \times 10^1 + 3 \times 10^0
$$

$$
= 2 \times 100 + 5 \times 10 + 3 \times 1
$$

$$
= 200 + 50 + 3 = 253\_{10}
$$

### Examples of Decimal Numbers:

1. $7\_{10}$

$$
7 \times 10^0 = 7\_{10}
$$

2. $15\_{10}$

$$
1 \times 10^1 + 5 \times 10^0 = 10 + 5 = 15\_{10}
$$

3. $402\_{10}$

$$
4 \times 10^2 + 0 \times 10^1 + 2 \times 10^0 = 400 + 0 + 2 = 402\_{10}
$$

4. $1000\_{10}$

$$
1 \times 10^3 + 0 \times 10^2 + 0 \times 10^1 + 0 \times 10^0 = 1000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1000\_{10}
$$

### Conversion Between Decimal and Other Number Systems:

#### 1. **Decimal to Binary**:

Divide the decimal number by 2 repeatedly and record the remainders.

Example: Convert $25\_{10}$ to binary.

$$
25 \div 2 = 12 \quad \text{remainder } 1
$$

$$
12 \div 2 = 6 \quad \text{remainder } 0
$$

$$
6 \div 2 = 3 \quad \text{remainder } 0
$$

$$
3 \div 2 = 1 \quad \text{remainder } 1
$$

$$
1 \div 2 = 0 \quad \text{remainder } 1
$$

Read the remainders in reverse order: $11001_2$.

#### 2. **Binary to Decimal**:

Multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2 and sum the results.

Example: Convert $1011\_{2}$ to decimal.

$$
1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0
$$

$$
= 1 \times 8 + 0 \times 4 + 1 \times 2 + 1 \times 1
$$

$$
= 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11\_{10}
$$

#### 3. **Decimal to Octal**:

Divide the decimal number by 8 repeatedly and record the remainders.

Example: Convert $95\_{10}$ to octal.

$$
95 \div 8 = 11 \quad \text{remainder } 7
$$

$$
11 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder } 3
$$

$$
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder } 1
$$

Read the remainders in reverse order: $137_8$.

#### 4. **Octal to Decimal**:

Multiply each octal digit by its corresponding power of 8 and sum the results.

Example: Convert $157\_{8}$ to decimal.

$$
1 \times 8^2 + 5 \times 8^1 + 7 \times 8^0
$$

$$
= 1 \times 64 + 5 \times 8 + 7 \times 1
$$

$$
= 64 + 40 + 7 = 111\_{10}
$$

#### 5. **Decimal to Hexadecimal**:

Divide the decimal number by 16 repeatedly and record the remainders.

Example: Convert $255\_{10}$ to hexadecimal.

$$
255 \div 16 = 15 \quad \text{remainder } 15 \, (\text{F})
$$

$$
15 \div 16 = 0 \quad \text{remainder } 15 \, (\text{F})
$$

Read the remainders in reverse order: $FF\_{16}$.

#### 6. **Hexadecimal to Decimal**:

Multiply each hexadecimal digit by its corresponding power of 16 and sum the results.

Example: Convert $1A3\_{16}$ to decimal.

$$
1 \times 16^2 + 10 \times 16^1 + 3 \times 16^0
$$

$$
= 1 \times 256 + 10 \times 16 + 3 \times 1
$$

$$
= 256 + 160 + 3 = 419\_{10}
$$

### Applications of the Decimal System:

1. **Everyday Use**: Used in counting, money, measurements, and most real-world applications.
2. **Science and Engineering**: Standard for representing numerical data.
3. **Computing**: Used in high-level programming and user interfaces.

---

### Advantages of the Decimal System:

1. **Intuitive**: Aligns with human counting (10 fingers).
2. **Universal**: Standardized and understood globally.
3. **Flexible**: Easily converts to other number systems.

---

### Summary:

The decimal number system is a base-10 system that uses digits 0â€“9. It is the most widely used numeral system due to its simplicity and alignment with human counting. Conversions between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal systems are essential in computing and digital systems.
