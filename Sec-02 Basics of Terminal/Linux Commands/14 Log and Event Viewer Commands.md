### Log and Event Viewer Commands in Linux

Linux systems generate a variety of logs that record system events, application activities, and errors. These logs are crucial for troubleshooting, monitoring, and auditing system behavior. Below is a detailed explanation of the most commonly used log and event viewer commands in Linux, along with examples.

---

### **1. `journalctl`**

The `journalctl` command is used to query and display logs managed by `systemd`. It provides a centralized way to view logs from the system and services.

#### Syntax:

```bash
journalctl [options]
```

#### Examples:

- **View all logs:**

  ```bash
  sudo journalctl
  ```

- **View logs in reverse order (newest first):**

  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -r
  ```

- **View logs for a specific service:**

  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u <service_name>
  ```

  Example:

  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u nginx
  ```

- **View logs since a specific time:**

  ```bash
  sudo journalctl --since "2023-10-01 00:00:00"
  ```

- **View logs in real-time (follow mode):**

  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -f
  ```

- **Filter logs by priority (e.g., error logs):**
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -p err
  ```

### **2. `dmesg`**

The `dmesg` command displays kernel ring buffer messages, which include information about hardware, drivers, and kernel events.

#### Syntax:

```bash
dmesg [options]
```

#### Examples:

- **View all kernel messages:**

  ```bash
  dmesg
  ```

- **View kernel messages related to USB devices:**

  ```bash
  dmesg | grep -i usb
  ```

- **View the last 10 kernel messages:**
  ```bash
  dmesg | tail -n 10
  ```

---

### **3. `tail`**

The `tail` command is used to view the end of a file, commonly used for log files.

#### Syntax:

```bash
tail [options] <file>
```

#### Examples:

- **View the last 10 lines of a log file:**

  ```bash
  tail /var/log/syslog
  ```

- **View the last 50 lines of a log file:**

  ```bash
  tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog
  ```

- **Follow a log file in real-time:**
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/syslog
  ```

---

### **4. `less`**

The `less` command is used to view files interactively, allowing you to scroll through large log files.

#### Syntax:

```bash
less <file>
```

#### Examples:

- **View a log file:**

  ```bash
  less /var/log/syslog
  ```

  - Use `Page Up`/`Page Down` or arrow keys to navigate.
  - Press `q` to quit.

- **Search for a keyword in the log file:**
  - Press `/` followed by the keyword (e.g., `/error`).
  - Press `n` to go to the next match.

---

### **5. `grep`**

The `grep` command is used to search for specific patterns in log files.

#### Syntax:

```bash
grep [options] <pattern> <file>
```

#### Examples:

- **Search for the word "error" in a log file:**

  ```bash
  grep "error" /var/log/syslog
  ```

- **Search for the word "error" case-insensitively:**

  ```bash
  grep -i "error" /var/log/syslog
  ```

- **Search for multiple patterns:**

  ```bash
  grep -e "error" -e "warning" /var/log/syslog
  ```

- **Search for a pattern in all files in a directory:**
  ```bash
  grep "error" /var/log/*
  ```

---

### **6. `cat`**

The `cat` command is used to display the contents of a file.

#### Syntax:

```bash
cat <file>
```

#### Examples:

- **Display the contents of a log file:**

  ```bash
  cat /var/log/syslog
  ```

- **Combine multiple files:**
  ```bash
  cat /var/log/syslog /var/log/auth.log
  ```

---

### **7. `awk`**

The `awk` command is a powerful text-processing tool that can be used to filter and format log files.

#### Syntax:

```bash
awk '<pattern> { <action> }' <file>
```

#### Examples:

- **Print the first column of a log file:**

  ```bash
  awk '{print $1}' /var/log/syslog
  ```

- **Filter logs by a specific field (e.g., timestamp):**
  ```bash
  awk '/Oct 10/ {print $0}' /var/log/syslog
  ```

---

### **8. `sed`**

The `sed` command is a stream editor used to perform basic text transformations on log files.

#### Syntax:

```bash
sed '<expression>' <file>
```

#### Examples:

- **Replace a word in a log file:**

  ```bash
  sed 's/error/ERROR/g' /var/log/syslog
  ```

- **Delete lines containing a specific word:**
  ```bash
  sed '/error/d' /var/log/syslog
  ```

---

### **9. `find`**

The `find` command is used to search for files in a directory hierarchy.

#### Syntax:

```bash
find <directory> [options]
```

#### Examples:

- **Find all log files modified in the last 7 days:**

  ```bash
  find /var/log -name "*.log" -mtime -7
  ```

- **Find and display the contents of log files containing the word "error":**
  ```bash
  find /var/log -name "*.log" -exec grep -l "error" {} \;
  ```

---

### **10. `logrotate`**

The `logrotate` command is used to manage log file rotation, compression, and deletion.

logrotate [options] <config_file>
```

#### Examples:

- **Manually rotate logs:**
  ```bash
  sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.conf
  ```

### **11. `auditd` (Audit Daemon)**

The `auditd` service is used to monitor and log system events for security auditing.

  cat /etc/rsyslog.conf
  ```

- **Restart the `rsyslog` service:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
