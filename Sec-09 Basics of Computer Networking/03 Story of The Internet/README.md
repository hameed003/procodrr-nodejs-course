## **1. The Early Idea (1950s - 1960s) 🚀**  
Before the internet, computers were **big, expensive, and isolated**. Scientists and governments needed a way to share data between them.  

- **1957:** The Soviet Union launched **Sputnik-1**, the first satellite. This scared the U.S., leading to the creation of **ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency)** to improve technology.  
- **1961:** Leonard Kleinrock developed the idea of **packet switching**, a method of breaking data into small pieces to send across a network.  
- **1969:** **ARPANET**, the first computer network, was born, connecting **four universities in the U.S.**  

🔹 **First message sent:** “LO” (They tried to send “LOGIN,” but the system crashed after two letters!)

## **2. The Birth of the Internet (1970s - 1980s) 🌐**  
The need for a common communication method led to the invention of **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)** by **Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn** in 1974.  

- **1983:** TCP/IP became the standard for networking, marking the true birth of the **internet**.  
- **1984:** **DNS (Domain Name System)** was introduced, replacing numeric IP addresses with human-readable names (e.g., google.com).  
- **1989:** **Tim Berners-Lee** invented the **World Wide Web (WWW)** at CERN, making the internet easier to use.
