# CMD/CLI/CUI

CLI stands for Command Line Interface, which is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer's operating system by entering commands. CLIs are also known as command-line user interfaces, console user interfaces, and character user interfaces.

CLIs are more flexible and powerful than graphical user interfaces (GUIs). They can be faster and more efficient, especially when working with large amounts of files or repetitive tasks.

| In CUI (Character User Interface), the user has to type all the commands using the keyboard to interact with the computer. | In GUI (Graphical User Interface), the user uses a mouse instead of the keyboard to interact with the computer. |
| It is difficult to use as the user has to remember all the commands.                                                       | It is much easier to use and navigate.                                                                          |
| There is only text in case of CUI.                                                                                         | There are graphics or visual clues for each application.                                                        |
| Old computers used CUI.                                                                                                    | Most modern computers use GUI.                                                                                  |
| **Example:** DOS                                                                                                           | **Example:** Windows                                                                                            |

# **1. CLI Options in Windows**

1. **CMD** (Used for system administrator and standard user)

# **2. CLI Options in Linux**

Linux has multiple command-line interfaces, including:

- **Terminal** (Default CLI for most distributions)
- **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** – Most commonly used shell
- **Zsh (Z Shell)** – More advanced features than Bash
- **Sh (Bourne Shell)** – Simpler shell for scripting
- **Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)** – User-friendly with auto-suggestions

# **3. CLI Options in macOS**

macOS provides these CLI tools:

- **Terminal.app** (Default CLI)
- **Bash** (Default shell in older macOS versions)
- **Zsh** (Default shell since macOS Catalina)
- **Fish** (Optional, for an enhanced CLI experience)
