Great question! Let’s break it down step by step.

## **How Does Your Friend’s Hotspot Assign Your Phone a Public IPv6 Address?**

### **1. Mobile Networks Use IPv6 With Global Addresses**

- Unlike traditional home networks, most **mobile networks (like 4G/5G)** use **IPv6 natively**.
- When your friend’s phone enables the **hotspot (tethering)**, their mobile network **assigns an IPv6 prefix to all connected devices**.
- Your phone gets a **publicly routable IPv6 address** from the mobile carrier.

### **2. Example of IPv6 Assignment in Mobile Hotspots**

Let’s assume:

- Your friend’s phone has a **carrier-assigned IPv6 address** like:
  ```
  2001:db8:abcd:1234::1
  ```
- Their hotspot **shares an IPv6 subnet** with connected devices.  
  Your phone gets an address like:
  ```
  2001:db8:abcd:1234::100
  ```

This means **your phone has a publicly accessible IPv6 address** that can be reached directly from the internet (assuming no firewall restrictions).

## **What Happens When You Make a Request on the Internet?**

When your phone (running the Node.js server) makes a request to an external website, here’s what happens:

1. **Your Phone (Server) Sends the Request**

   - If you visit `https://example.com`, your phone's browser sends a request **from its IPv6 address (e.g., `2001:db8:abcd:1234::100`)**.

2. **The Request Travels Through the Mobile Network**

   - The request **first goes to your friend’s mobile carrier**, which routes the traffic **without changing your IPv6 address** (unlike IPv4 NAT).
   - Since IPv6 does **not require NAT**, your request reaches the destination website **directly**.

3. **The Website Responds**

   - Example.com sees the request coming from `2001:db8:abcd:1234::100` (your phone’s IPv6 address).
   - It sends the response **directly back to your phone** via IPv6.

4. **Your Friend’s Phone is NOT Involved in Routing**
   - The mobile carrier handles all IPv6 routing.
   - **Your friend’s phone (hotspot) is just a bridge**, passing IPv6 packets **without modification**.
   - The request **does NOT get processed by your friend’s phone**, but instead, it’s handled by the carrier’s network.

## **How Is This Different from IPv4 Hotspots?**

With IPv4:

- Most mobile networks use **Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)**.
- Your phone would **get a private IPv4 address**, like `192.168.43.100`.
- Requests would go through **your friend’s phone (as a NAT gateway)**.
- The public IP would **belong to your friend’s phone, not yours**.

With IPv6:

- Your phone gets a **real public IPv6 address**.
- The request **goes directly to the internet** without passing through your friend's phone.

## **Why Can’t a Device on a Wi-Fi Network Access Your Server?**

- **Your friend’s mobile carrier allows inbound IPv6 traffic** (so your server is accessible).
- **Most Wi-Fi networks don’t support IPv6 properly**.
- Your Wi-Fi device may only have **IPv4**, meaning it **cannot reach your phone’s IPv6 address**.
