### **IP Address: Definition and Purpose**

An **IP address** (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It enables devices to communicate with each other by providing a way to locate and identify them. IP addresses are essential for routing data packets across networks, including the internet.

---

### **Types of IP Addresses**

There are two main types of IP addresses:

#### **1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)**

- **Format**: 32-bit address, represented as four decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
- **Example**: `192.168.1.1`
- **Limitations**:
  - Limited address space (approximately 4.3 billion addresses).
  - Exhaustion of available addresses due to the growth of the internet.

#### **2. IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)**

- **Format**: 128-bit address, represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
- **Example**: `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`
- **Advantages**:
  - Vast address space (approximately \(3.4 \times 10^{38}\) addresses).
  - Improved security and efficiency.

---

### **Classes of IPv4 Addresses**

IPv4 addresses are divided into five classes (A, B, C, D, and E) based on the value of the first octet and the default subnet mask. Each class is designed for different network sizes.

| **Class** | **First Octet Range**            | **Default Subnet Mask** | **Purpose**                                                     |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A**     | `1.0.0.0` to `126.0.0.0`         | `255.0.0.0` (`/8`)      | Large networks (e.g., multinational corporations).              |
| **B**     | `128.0.0.0` to `191.255.0.0`     | `255.255.0.0` (`/16`)   | Medium-sized networks (e.g., universities, large businesses).   |
| **C**     | `192.0.0.0` to `223.255.255.0`   | `255.255.255.0` (`/24`) | Small networks (e.g., small businesses, home networks).         |
| **D**     | `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255` | N/A                     | Multicasting (sending data to multiple devices simultaneously). |
| **E**     | `240.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255` | N/A                     | Reserved for experimental or future use.                        |

<details><summary>Difference between 0.0.0.0 and 127.0.0.1 IP Address </summary>

### Difference Between `0.0.0.0` and `127.0.0.1`

Both `0.0.0.0` and `127.0.0.1` are special IP addresses used in networking, but they serve very different purposes. Below is a detailed explanation of each, along with examples to illustrate their differences.

---

### **1. `0.0.0.0`**

- **Meaning**: `0.0.0.0` is a **non-routable meta-address** used to represent:

  - **All IPv4 addresses** on a machine (i.e., all interfaces).
  - A **default route** in routing tables.
  - A **wildcard address** in server configurations to listen on all available interfaces.

- **Use Cases**:

  - **Listening on All Interfaces**: When a server is configured to listen on `0.0.0.0`, it accepts connections from any IP address assigned to the machine.
  - **Default Route**: In routing tables, `0.0.0.0` represents the default route (i.e., the route used when no specific route matches the destination).

### **Example 1: Listening on `0.0.0.0`**

When a Node.js server listens on `0.0.0.0`, it accepts connections from **any IP address** assigned to the machine. This makes the server accessible from other devices on the network.

#### **Code Example**

```javascript
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
  res.end("Hello, World!\n");
});

server.listen(3000, "0.0.0.0", () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on 0.0.0.0:3000");
});
```

#### **Explanation**

- The server listens on `0.0.0.0:3000`.
- It will accept connections from:
  - The local machine (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`).
  - Any other device on the network (e.g., `192.168.1.100`).

#### **Testing**

1. Run the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. Access the server from the local machine:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```
3. Access the server from another device on the network:
   ```bash
   curl http://192.168.1.100:3000
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

---

### **2. `127.0.0.1`**

- **Meaning**: `127.0.0.1` is the **loopback address** used to refer to the local machine itself. It is part of the `127.0.0.0/8` range reserved for loopback addresses.

  - **Loopback**: Traffic sent to `127.0.0.1` never leaves the machine; it is routed back to the same device.
  - **Local Testing**: Used for testing and development purposes to simulate network connections on the same machine.

- **Use Cases**:

  - **Local Server**: When a server is configured to listen on `127.0.0.1`, it only accepts connections from the local machine.
  - **Testing**: Developers use `127.0.0.1` to test applications without exposing them to the network.

- **Examples**:

### **Example 2: Listening on `127.0.0.1`**

When a Node.js server listens on `127.0.0.1`, it only accepts connections from the **local machine**. This is useful for development and testing.

#### **Code Example**

```javascript
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
  res.end("Hello, World!\n");
});

server.listen(3000, "127.0.0.1", () => {
  console.log("Server is listening on 127.0.0.1:3000");
});
```

#### **Explanation**

- The server listens on `127.0.0.1:3000`.
- It will **only** accept connections from the local machine.

#### **Testing**

1. Run the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
2. Access the server from the local machine:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```
3. Attempt to access the server from another device on the network:
   ```bash
   curl http://192.168.1.100:3000
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Connection refused
   ```

---

### **When to Use Each**

#### **Use `0.0.0.0` When**:

- You want the server to be accessible from other devices on the network.
- Example: A production web server or API.

#### **Use `127.0.0.1` When**:

- You are developing or testing an application and want to restrict access to the local machine.
- Example: A local development server.

---

**Testing a Local Application**:

- If you run a database server on `127.0.0.1:3306`, only applications on the same machine can connect to it.
- Example MySQL connection:
  ```bash
  mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p
  ```
