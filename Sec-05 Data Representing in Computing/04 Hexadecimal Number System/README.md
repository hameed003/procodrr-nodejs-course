The **hexadecimal number system**, also known as the **base-16 number system**, is a positional numeral system that uses sixteen distinct symbols: **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F**. It is widely used in computing and digital systems because it provides a more compact representation of binary data.

### Key Features of the Hexadecimal Number System:

1. **Base-16 System**: Each digit represents a power of 16.
2. **Digits**: Uses digits 0–9 and letters A–F (where A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14, F = 15).
3. **Positional Value**: The value of each digit is determined by its position, starting from the right (least significant digit) to the left (most significant digit).
4. **Compact Representation**: Each hexadecimal digit represents 4 binary digits (bits), making it easier to work with binary data.

### How the Hexadecimal System Works:

In the hexadecimal system, each digit represents a power of 16. The rightmost digit is $16^0$, the next digit to the left is $16^1$, then $16^2$, and so on.

For example:

- The hexadecimal number $1A3\_{16}$ can be expanded as:

$$
1 \times 16^2 + A \times 16^1 + 3 \times 16^0
$$

$$
  = 1 \times 256 + 10 \times 16 + 3 \times 1
$$

$$
  = 256 + 160 + 3 = 419\_{10}
$$

So, $1A3\_{16}$ in hexadecimal is equal to $419\_{10}$ in decimal.

### Examples of Hexadecimal Numbers:

1. $F\_{16}$

$$
F \times 16^0 = 15\_{10}
$$

2. $10\_{16}$

$$
1 \times 16^1 + 0 \times 16^0 = 16 + 0 = 16\_{10}
$$

3. $2B\_{16}$

$$
2 \times 16^1 + B \times 16^0 = 32 + 11 = 43\_{10}
$$

4. $100\_{16}$

$$
1 \times 16^2 + 0 \times 16^1 + 0 \times 16^0 = 256 + 0 + 0 = 256\_{10}
$$

### Conversion Between Hexadecimal and Other Number Systems:

#### 1. **Hexadecimal to Decimal**:

Multiply each digit by its corresponding power of 16 and sum the results.

Example: Convert $1F2\_{16}$ to decimal.

$$
1 \times 16^2 + F \times 16^1 + 2 \times 16^0
$$

$$
= 1 \times 256 + 15 \times 16 + 2 \times 1
$$

$$
= 256 + 240 + 2 = 498\_{10}
$$

#### 2. **Decimal to Hexadecimal**:

Divide the decimal number by 16 repeatedly and record the remainders.

Example: Convert $255\_{10}$ to hexadecimal.

$$
255 \div 16 = 15 \quad \text{remainder } 15 \, (\text{F})
$$

$$
15 \div 16 = 0 \quad \text{remainder } 15 \, (\text{F})
$$

Read the remainders in reverse order: $FF\_{16}$.

#### 3. **Hexadecimal to Binary**:

Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to exactly 4 binary digits.

Example: Convert $A5\_{16}$ to binary.

$$
A\_{16} = 1010\_{2}, \quad 5\_{16} = 0101_2
$$

Combine the binary digits: $10100101_2$.

#### 4. **Binary to Hexadecimal**:

Group binary digits into sets of 4 (starting from the right) and convert each group to its hexadecimal equivalent.

Example: Convert $11010110\_{2}$ to hexadecimal.

$$
1101_2 = D\_{16}, \quad 0110*2 = 6\_{16}
$$

Combine the hexadecimal digits: $D6\_{16}$.

#### 5. **Hexadecimal to Octal**:

First convert hexadecimal to binary, then binary to octal.

Example: Convert $2E\_{16}$ to octal.

$$
2\_{16} = 0010\_{2}, \quad E\_{16} = 1110\_{2}
$$

Combine the binary digits: $00101110_2$.
Group into sets of 3: $001 \, 011 \, 100_2$.
Convert to octal: $1 \, 3 \, 4_8$.
So, $2E\_{16} = 134_8$.

#### 6. **Octal to Hexadecimal**:

First convert octal to binary, then binary to hexadecimal.

Example: Convert $345\_{8}$ to hexadecimal.

$$
3_8 = 011_2, \quad 4_8 = 100_2, \quad 5_8 = 101_2
$$

Combine the binary digits: $011100101_2$.
Group into sets of 4: $0111 \, 0010 \, 1000_2$.
Convert to hexadecimal: $7 \, 2 \, 8\_{16}$.
So, $345\_{8} = 728\_{16}$.

### Applications of the Hexadecimal System:

1. **Computing**: Used to represent memory addresses, binary data, and color codes.
2. **Programming**: Commonly used in low-level programming and debugging.
3. **Digital Systems**: Simplifies the representation of binary data in hardware design.

---

### Advantages of the Hexadecimal System:

1. **Compact Representation**: Easier to read and write than binary.
2. **Simplifies Binary**: Groups of 4 binary digits correspond directly to hexadecimal digits.
3. **Efficient**: Reduces the length of binary data representations.

### Summary:

The hexadecimal number system is a base-16 system that uses digits 0–9 and letters A–F. It is widely used in computing and digital systems for its compact representation of binary data. Conversions between hexadecimal, binary, and decimal are straightforward due to the relationship between powers of 2 and 16.
