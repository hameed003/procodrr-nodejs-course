In **Node.js**, you should choose between a **new process** or a **thread** based on the task:

---

### ðŸ§µ Use a **Thread** (`worker_threads`)

âœ… Best for **CPU-intensive tasks** (e.g., calculations, image processing)
ðŸ”§ Example:

```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
new Worker('./heavyTask.js');
```

---

### ðŸ”„ Use a **New Process** (`child_process`)

âœ… Best for **external commands or running scripts** (e.g., running Python, shell commands)
ðŸ”§ Example:

```js
const { spawn } = require('child_process');
spawn('python', ['script.py']);
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Rule of Thumb:

* **Threads** = Share memory (lightweight, parallel logic)
* **Processes** = Isolated (great for external tools or stability)
