### SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)

**SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)** is a command-line tool used to securely transfer files and directories between a local machine and a remote server or between two remote servers. It is based on the **SSH (Secure Shell)** protocol, ensuring that all data transferred is encrypted for security.

### Key Features of SCP

1. **Secure File Transfer**: Uses SSH for encryption, ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.
2. **Simple Syntax**: Easy-to-use command-line interface.
3. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with tools like PuTTY’s `pscp`).
4. **Recursive Copy**: Can copy entire directories and their contents.

### SCP Command Syntax

The basic syntax for the `scp` command is:

```bash
scp [options] source destination
```

- **source**: The file or directory to be copied.
- **destination**: The location where the file or directory will be copied.
- **options**: Additional flags to customize the behavior of the `scp` command.

### Common SCP Options

| Option | Description                                                          |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-P`   | Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host (default is 22). |
| `-r`   | Recursively copies entire directories.                               |
| `-v`   | Enables verbose mode for debugging.                                  |
| `-C`   | Compresses data during transfer.                                     |
| `-i`   | Specifies the identity file (private key) for authentication.        |
| `-p`   | Preserves file modification times, access times, and modes.          |

### Examples of SCP Usage

#### **1. Copy a File from Local to Remote**

- Copy a file from your local machine to a remote server:
  ```bash
  scp myfile.txt user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/
  ```
  - `myfile.txt`: The file to be copied.
  - `user@192.168.1.100`: The username and IP address of the remote server.
  - `/home/user/`: The destination directory on the remote server.

#### **2. Copy a File from Remote to Local**

- Copy a file from a remote server to your local machine:
  ```bash
  scp user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/myfile.txt /local/directory/
  ```
  - `user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/myfile.txt`: The file on the remote server.
  - `/local/directory/`: The destination directory on your local machine.

#### **3. Copy a Directory Recursively**

- Copy an entire directory from your local machine to a remote server:
  ```bash
  scp -r myfolder/ user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/
  ```
  - `-r`: Recursively copies the directory and its contents.
  - `myfolder/`: The directory to be copied.

#### **4. Copy a File Using a Specific Port**

- Copy a file to a remote server using a non-default SSH port (e.g., 2222):
  ```bash
  scp -P 2222 myfile.txt user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/
  ```
  - `-P 2222`: Specifies the SSH port (note: uppercase `-P` for port).

#### **5. Copy a File with Compression**

- Compress data during transfer to speed up the process:
  ```bash
  scp -C myfile.txt user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/
  ```
  - `-C`: Enables compression.

#### **6. Copy a File Using a Private Key**

- Copy a file using an SSH private key for authentication:
  ```bash
  scp -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa myfile.txt user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/
  ```
  - `-i ~/.ssh/id_rsa`: Specifies the private key file.

#### **7. Copy a File Between Two Remote Servers**

- Copy a file from one remote server to another:
  ```bash
  scp user1@192.168.1.100:/home/user1/myfile.txt user2@192.168.1.101:/home/user2/
  ```
  - `user1@192.168.1.100:/home/user1/myfile.txt`: The source file on the first remote server.
  - `user2@192.168.1.101:/home/user2/`: The destination directory on the second remote server.

### Using SCP on Windows

Windows does not have a built-in `scp` command, but you can use **PuTTY’s `pscp`** (PuTTY Secure Copy) or **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.

#### **Using PuTTY’s `pscp`**

1. Download PuTTY from [https://www.putty.org](https://www.putty.org).
2. Use the `pscp` command in the Command Prompt or PowerShell:
   ```bash
   pscp myfile.txt user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/
   ```

#### **Using WSL**

1. Install WSL from the Microsoft Store (e.g., Ubuntu).
2. Use the `scp` command in the WSL terminal:
   ```bash
   scp myfile.txt user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/
   ```

### Best Practices for Using SCP

1. **Use SSH Keys for Authentication**:

   - Avoid using passwords and instead use SSH keys for secure and passwordless authentication.

2. **Compress Data for Large Transfers**:

   - Use the `-C` option to compress data and speed up transfers.

3. **Preserve File Attributes**:

   - Use the `-p` option to preserve file timestamps and permissions.

4. **Verify Transfers**:
   - After transferring files, verify their integrity using checksums (e.g., `md5sum` or `sha256sum`).

---

### Summary

- **SCP** is a secure and efficient tool for transferring files and directories over SSH.
- It supports local-to-remote, remote-to-local, and remote-to-remote transfers.
- Common options include `-r` for recursive copying, `-P` for specifying ports, and `-i` for using private keys.
- On Windows, you can use PuTTY’s `pscp` or WSL to run `scp`.

SCP is a reliable choice for secure file transfers, especially when working with remote servers.
