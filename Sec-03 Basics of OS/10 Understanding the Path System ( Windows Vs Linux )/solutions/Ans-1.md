Sure! Here's a simple explanation:

### 🧑‍💻 Why Windows uses `\` instead of `/`

In **early versions of MS-DOS (before Windows)**, the **forward slash `/`** was already being used for **command options**.

#### 🔹 Example:

```bash
dir /w
```

* Here, `/w` means **"wide view"** in the `dir` command.
* So, `/` was treated as an **option flag**, not a path separator.

### ❌ Problem:

If you wrote:

```bash
C:/Users/Ahmad
```

MS-DOS might **think `/Users` is an option**, not a folder.

---

### ✅ Solution:

To avoid confusion, Microsoft chose the **backslash `\`** for separating folders:

```bash
C:\Users\Ahmad
```

This became the **standard in Windows**.

---

### 🔔 Note:

Linux/Unix never used `/` for options, so they kept `/` as the **path separator**.
