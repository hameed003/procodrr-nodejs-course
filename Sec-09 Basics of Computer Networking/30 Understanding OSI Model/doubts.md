**Q1:** In how many `Physical Forms` our data can travel over the internet and which `Layer` of the `OSI model` is responsible for generating and converting data in different forms. [Ans-1](https://github.com/hameed003/procodrr-nodejs-course/blob/main/Sec-09%20Basics%20of%20Computer%20Networking/30%20Understanding%20OSI%20Model/solutions/Ans-1.md)

**Q2:** If i am connected to my `Home Wifi Router` and search for a `website` on the internet, now explain each and everything about how here the `OSI model` will be implemented, explain each `Layer` in detail, like how my digital signal will be converted to radio waves etc. and also in which form our router will send data to it's next node. [Ans-2](https://github.com/hameed003/procodrr-nodejs-course/blob/main/Sec-09%20Basics%20of%20Computer%20Networking/30%20Understanding%20OSI%20Model/solutions/Ans-2.md)

**Q3:** Can I say my Laptop is capable of implementing all the `7 layer` of the `OSI model`. [Ans-3](https://github.com/hameed003/procodrr-nodejs-course/blob/main/Sec-09%20Basics%20of%20Computer%20Networking/30%20Understanding%20OSI%20Model/solutions/Ans-3.md)

**Q4:** How many `OSI layers` can a modern `Home Wifi Router` can perform and which part of the `Router` implements that particular `Layer`, consider the previous example and explain each and everything that happens in the `Router` once our data reaches to it. [Ans-4](https://github.com/hameed003/procodrr-nodejs-course/blob/main/Sec-09%20Basics%20of%20Computer%20Networking/30%20Understanding%20OSI%20Model/solutions/Ans-4.md)

**Q5:** Can I say that my `Laptop` can perform all the `7 Layers of the OSI model` except `Network Layer`. [Ans-5](https://github.com/hameed003/procodrr-nodejs-course/blob/main/Sec-09%20Basics%20of%20Computer%20Networking/30%20Understanding%20OSI%20Model/solutions/Ans-5.md)

**Q6:** Suppose if a device support `Layer 4 of OSI model`, is it understood that it will automatically support `Layer 3`, `Layer 2` and `Layer 1`. [Ans-6](https://github.com/hameed003/procodrr-nodejs-course/blob/main/Sec-09%20Basics%20of%20Computer%20Networking/30%20Understanding%20OSI%20Model/solutions/Ans-6.md)

**Q7:** What are other devices apart from `Routers` and `Laptops` that supports at least up to `Layer 4` or above of the `OSI model`. [Ans-7](https://github.com/hameed003/procodrr-nodejs-course/blob/main/Sec-09%20Basics%20of%20Computer%20Networking/30%20Understanding%20OSI%20Model/solutions/Ans-7.md)
