In Windows, you can delete files using the **`del`** (or **`erase`**) command in the Command Prompt (CMD). Below is a detailed explanation of the `del` command with examples:

---

### **1. Delete a Single File**

The `del` command is used to delete one or more files.

#### **Syntax**

```
del [filename]
```

---

#### **Examples of Deleting Files**

1. **Delete a File in the Current Directory**:

   - Delete a file named `file.txt`:
     ```
     del file.txt
     ```

2. **Delete a File with Spaces in the Name**:

   - Delete a file named `my file.txt`:
     ```
     del "my file.txt"
     ```

3. **Delete a File in a Different Directory**:
   - Delete a file named `file.txt` located in `C:\Backup`:
     ```
     del C:\Backup\file.txt
     ```

---

### **2. Delete Multiple Files**

You can use wildcards (`*` and `?`) to delete multiple files at once.

#### **Examples of Deleting Multiple Files**

1. **Delete All `.txt` Files**:

   - Delete all `.txt` files in the current directory:
     ```
     del *.txt
     ```

2. **Delete Files with a Specific Prefix**:

   - Delete all files starting with `temp_`:
     ```
     del temp_*.*
     ```

3. **Delete Files with a Specific Pattern**:

   - Delete all files with the pattern `file?.txt`:
     ```
     del file?.txt
     ```

4. **Delete All Files in a Directory**:
   - Delete all files in the current directory:
     ```
     del *.*
     ```
   - You will be prompted to confirm the deletion:
     ```
     Are you sure (Y/N)?
     ```

### **3. Delete Files with Options**

The `del` command supports several options to modify its behavior.

#### **Options**

- **`/p`**: Prompts for confirmation before deleting each file.
- **`/f`**: Forces deletion of read-only files.
- **`/s`**: Deletes specified files from the current directory and all subdirectories.
- **`/q`**: Quiet mode. Suppresses confirmation prompts.

---

#### **Examples of Using Options**

1. **Prompt Before Deleting Each File**:

   - Delete all `.txt` files with a confirmation prompt for each file:
     ```
     del /p *.txt
     ```

2. **Force Delete Read-Only Files**:

   - Delete a read-only file named `readonly.txt`:
     ```
     del /f readonly.txt
     ```

3. **Delete Files in the Current Directory and All Subdirectories**:

   - Delete all `.tmp` files in the current directory and all subdirectories:
     ```
     del /s *.tmp
     ```

4. **Delete Files Without Confirmation**:
   - Delete all `.log` files without prompting for confirmation:
     ```
     del /q *.log
     ```

---

### **Common Errors and Solutions**

1. **File Not Found**:

   - Ensure the file name and path are correct.
   - Example:
     ```
     del nonExistentFile.txt
     ```
     Error: `Could Not Find [filename]`

2. **Permission Denied**:

   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to delete the file.
   - Example:
     ```
     del C:\Windows\system32\file.txt
     ```
     Error: `Access is denied.`

3. **Invalid File Name**:

   - Ensure the file name does not contain invalid characters (`\`, `/`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`).
   - Example:
     ```
     del invalid/file.txt
     ```
     Error: `The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.`

4. **Deleting All Files in a Directory**:
   - Be cautious when using `del *.*` as it will delete all files in the current directory.
   - Example:
     ```
     del *.*
     ```
     Prompt: `Are you sure (Y/N)?`
