Vim (Vi IMproved) is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. It is an enhanced version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems. Vim is often called a "programmer's editor," and is so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing configuration files.

### Installation

Vim can be installed on various platforms:

- **Linux**: Most Linux distributions come with Vim pre-installed. If not, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:

  ```bash

- **macOS**: Vim comes pre-installed. You can also install it via Homebrew:

  ```bash
