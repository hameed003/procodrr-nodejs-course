### What is PuTTY?

**PuTTY** is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console, and network file transfer application. It is primarily used for **SSH (Secure Shell)** connections to remote servers, but it also supports other protocols like **Telnet**, **rlogin**, and **SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)**. PuTTY is widely used on Windows systems, although it can also be used on other platforms with the help of compatibility layers like **Wine**.

#### **Step 4: Using PuTTY for File Transfer**

1. **SCP**:
   - Use a command-line SCP client (e.g., `pscp.exe` included with PuTTY) to transfer files.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     pscp myfile.txt user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/
     ```
2. **SFTP**:
   - Use a graphical SFTP client like **WinSCP** or the command-line `psftp.exe` included with PuTTY.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     psftp user@192.168.1.100
     ```

   - Select **SSH** as the connection type.
   - Click **Open**.

3. **Authenticate**:

   - Enter your username (e.g., `user`) and password when prompted.

4. **Execute Commands**:

### Advanced Features of PuTTY

1. **Public-Key Authentication**:

   - Generate an SSH key pair using **PuTTYgen** (included with PuTTY).
   - Copy the public key to the remote server’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
   - Configure PuTTY to use the private key for authentication.

2. **Port Forwarding**:

   - Set up SSH tunnels to securely forward traffic between local and remote ports.
   - Example: Forward local port 8080 to remote port 80:
     - Go to **Connection > SSH > Tunnels**.
     - Enter `8080` in **Source port** and `localhost:80` in **Destination**.
     - Click **Add**.

3. **Session Logging**:
   - Log all terminal activity to a file for troubleshooting or auditing.
   - Go to **Session > Logging** and configure the log file settings.
