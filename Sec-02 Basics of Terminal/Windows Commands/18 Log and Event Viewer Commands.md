In Windows, **Logs and Event Viewer** are essential tools for monitoring and troubleshooting system activities, errors, and security events. The **Event Viewer** provides a centralized interface to view and manage logs, while command-line tools like **`wevtutil`** allow you to interact with logs programmatically. Below is a detailed explanation of how to use these tools, along with examples:

---

### **1. Event Viewer**

The **Event Viewer** is a graphical tool that allows you to view and manage logs generated by the Windows operating system, applications, and services.

---

#### **Accessing Event Viewer**

1. **Using the GUI**:

   - Press `Win + R`, type `eventvwr`, and press `Enter`.

2. **Using Command Prompt (CMD)**:
   ```
   eventvwr
   ```

---

#### **Navigating Event Viewer**

1. **Windows Logs**:

   - **Application**: Logs related to applications.
   - **Security**: Logs related to security events (e.g., login attempts).
   - **Setup**: Logs related to system setup and configuration.
   - **System**: Logs related to system components (e.g., drivers, services).

2. **Applications and Services Logs**:
   - Logs specific to individual applications and services.

---

#### **Filtering Events**

1. **Filter by Event Level**:

   - Right-click on a log (e.g., `Application`) and select `Filter Current Log`.
   - Choose the event level (e.g., Error, Warning, Information).

2. **Filter by Event ID**:

   - In the `Filter Current Log` dialog, specify the `Event ID` (e.g., `1001`).

3. **Filter by Source**:
   - In the `Filter Current Log` dialog, specify the `Event Source` (e.g., `Windows Update`).

---

#### **Exporting Logs**

1. **Export a Log**:

   - Right-click on a log (e.g., `Application`) and select `Save All Events As`.
   - Choose a location and save the log in `.evtx` format.

2. **Open an Exported Log**:
   - In Event Viewer, go to `Action` > `Open Saved Log`.

---

### **2. Command-Line Tools for Log Management**

#### **`wevtutil` Command**

The `wevtutil` (Windows Event Utility) command is used to manage logs from the command line.

##### **Syntax**

```
wevtutil [command] [options]
```

##### **Examples**

1. **List All Logs**:

   ```
   wevtutil el
   ```

2. **Query Events from a Log**:

   ```
   wevtutil qe Application /f:text
   ```

3. **Export a Log**:

   ```
   wevtutil epl Application C:\Path\To\Log.evtx
   ```

4. **Clear a Log**:

   ```
   wevtutil cl Application
   ```

5. **Get Log Information**:

   ```
   wevtutil gli Application
   ```

6. **Set Log Properties**:
   ```
   wevtutil sl Application /ms:10485760
   ```
   - Sets the maximum size of the `Application` log to 10 MB.

---

#### **`Get-WinEvent` Command (PowerShell)**

The `Get-WinEvent` command is used to query events in PowerShell.

##### **Syntax**

```
Get-WinEvent [options]
```

##### **Examples**

1. **Query Events from a Log**:

   ```
   Get-WinEvent -LogName Application
   ```

2. **Filter Events by Event ID**:

   ```
   Get-WinEvent -LogName Application | Where-Object { $_.Id -eq 1001 }
   ```

3. **Filter Events by Time**:

   ```
   Get-WinEvent -LogName Application -MaxEvents 10
   ```

4. **Export Events to a CSV File**:
   ```
   Get-WinEvent -LogName Application | Export-Csv C:\Path\To\Log.csv
   ```

---

### **3. Common Logs and Event IDs**

#### **System Log**

- **Event ID 6005**: The Event Log service was started.
- **Event ID 6006**: The Event Log service was stopped.
- **Event ID 7001**: A service failed to start.

#### **Application Log**

- **Event ID 1000**: Application crash.
- **Event ID 1001**: Windows Error Reporting.

#### **Security Log**

- **Event ID 4624**: An account was successfully logged on.
- **Event ID 4625**: An account failed to log on.
- **Event ID 4648**: A logon was attempted using explicit credentials.

---

### **4. Analyzing Logs**

#### **Using Event Viewer**

1. **Identify Errors**:

   - Look for events with a red icon (Error) or yellow icon (Warning).

2. **Check Event Details**:

   - Double-click an event to view its details, including the event message, source, and event ID.

3. **Use Filters**:
   - Apply filters to narrow down the events (e.g., filter by `Event ID` or `Source`).

---

#### **Using PowerShell**

1. **Query Specific Events**:

   ```
   Get-WinEvent -LogName System | Where-Object { $_.Id -eq 7001 }
   ```

2. **Export Events for Analysis**:
   ```
   Get-WinEvent -LogName Application | Export-Csv C:\Path\To\Log.csv
   ```

---

### **5. Automating Log Management**

#### **Using Task Scheduler**

1. **Create a Task to Export Logs**:

   - Open `Task Scheduler` and create a new task.
   - Set the action to run a script that exports logs using `wevtutil` or `Get-WinEvent`.

2. **Create a Task to Clear Logs**:
   - Open `Task Scheduler` and create a new task.
   - Set the action to run a script that clears logs using `wevtutil`.
