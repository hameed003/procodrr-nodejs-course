These are called **path symbols** or **path notations** in Linux. More specifically:

| Symbol | Name                       | Meaning                             |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `.`    | Dot (Current Directory)    | Refers to current folder            |
| `..`   | Dot-Dot (Parent Directory) | Moves one level up                  |
| `../`  | Relative Path Up           | Go up and into another folder       |
| `~`    | Tilde (Home Directory)     | Represents user’s home folder       |
| `~/`   | Tilde Slash (Path in Home) | Specific path inside home directory |
| `/`    | Root                       | Top-most folder in Linux filesystem |

You can call them **path shorthand**, **navigation symbols**, or simply **relative path notations**.
