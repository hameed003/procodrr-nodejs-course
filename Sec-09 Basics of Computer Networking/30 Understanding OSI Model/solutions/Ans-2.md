Great question! Let’s break down the entire process of connecting to your home Wi-Fi router, searching for a website, and how the **OSI Model** is implemented at each layer. I’ll explain in detail how your digital signal is converted into radio waves, how the router processes the data, and how it travels through the internet.

### Scenario: You Search for a Website on Your Home Wi-Fi

1. **You Open a Browser and Type a URL**:
   - You open a browser (e.g., Chrome) and type `https://www.example.com`.

---

### Step-by-Step Implementation of the OSI Model

#### **Layer 7: Application Layer**

- **What Happens**: The browser generates an **HTTP/HTTPS request** for the website.
- **Details**:
  - The browser resolves the domain name (`www.example.com`) into an IP address using **DNS (Domain Name System)**.
  - The HTTP request is created to fetch the website content.
- **Example**: The browser sends a request like: `GET / HTTP/1.1 Host: www.example.com`.

---

#### **Layer 6: Presentation Layer**

- **What Happens**: The data is **encrypted** (if using HTTPS) and formatted for transmission.
- **Details**:
  - The HTTP request is encrypted using **SSL/TLS** (for HTTPS).
  - Data is encoded into a format suitable for transmission (e.g., binary or ASCII).
- **Example**: The HTTP request is encrypted into a secure TLS packet.

---

#### **Layer 5: Session Layer**

- **What Happens**: A **session** is established between your browser and the web server.
- **Details**:
  - The browser and server negotiate a secure connection (for HTTPS).
  - The session is maintained until the website is fully loaded or the connection is closed.
- **Example**: A TLS handshake establishes a secure session.

---

#### **Layer 4: Transport Layer**

- **What Happens**: The data is broken into **segments** and prepared for reliable delivery.
- **Details**:
  - **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)** is used for reliable delivery.
  - The HTTP request is divided into smaller **TCP segments**, each with a sequence number for reassembly.
  - A **port number** (e.g., port 443 for HTTPS) is added to identify the application (web browsing).
- **Example**: The HTTP request is encapsulated in a TCP segment with source and destination ports.

---

#### **Layer 3: Network Layer**

- **What Happens**: The data is packaged into **IP packets** for routing across the internet.
- **Details**:
  - The TCP segment is encapsulated in an **IP packet**.
  - Source and destination **IP addresses** are added (e.g., your device’s IP and the web server’s IP).
  - The router uses the destination IP address to determine the next hop.
- **Example**: The TCP segment is wrapped in an IP packet with:
  - Source IP: `192.168.1.10` (your device).
  - Destination IP: `93.184.216.34` (example.com’s server).

---

#### **Layer 2: Data Link Layer**

- **What Happens**: The IP packet is encapsulated into a **frame** for delivery over the local network.
- **Details**:
  - The IP packet is wrapped in an **Ethernet frame** (for wired connections) or a **Wi-Fi frame** (for wireless connections).
  - Source and destination **MAC addresses** are added:
    - Source MAC: Your device’s MAC address.
    - Destination MAC: Your Wi-Fi router’s MAC address.
  - Error detection is added using a **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**.
- **Example**: The IP packet is encapsulated in a Wi-Fi frame with:
  - Source MAC: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` (your device).
  - Destination MAC: `11:22:33:44:55:66` (your router).

---

#### **Layer 1: Physical Layer**

- **What Happens**: The Wi-Fi frame is converted into **radio waves** for transmission.
- **Details**:
  - The digital data (Wi-Fi frame) is converted into **radio waves** using modulation techniques like **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing)**.
  - The radio waves are transmitted over the air to your Wi-Fi router.
- **Example**: Your device’s Wi-Fi adapter sends the data as radio waves on the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz frequency band.

### What Happens at the Router?

1. **Receives the Radio Waves**:

   - The router’s Wi-Fi antenna receives the radio waves and converts them back into digital data (Wi-Fi frame).

2. **Processes the Data**:

   - The router checks the destination MAC address to confirm the frame is intended for it.
   - It strips the Wi-Fi frame to extract the IP packet.

3. **Forwards the Data**:
   - The router checks the destination IP address (`93.184.216.34`) and determines the next hop using its **routing table**.
   - The IP packet is encapsulated in a new frame (e.g., Ethernet or another Wi-Fi frame) for transmission to the next node (e.g., your ISP’s gateway).

---

### Data Travels Through the Internet

1. **From Router to ISP**:

   - The router sends the data to your ISP’s gateway, typically over a wired connection (e.g., fiber or coaxial cable).
   - The data is converted into **electrical signals** (for copper cables) or **light pulses** (for fiber optics).

2. **Across the Internet**:

   - The data travels through multiple routers and networks, with each router forwarding the packet based on the destination IP address.
   - At each hop, the data is converted into the appropriate physical form (e.g., electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves).

3. **Reaches the Web Server**:
   - The data arrives at the web server hosting `www.example.com`.
   - The server processes the request, retrieves the website content, and sends it back to your device using the same process in reverse.

### Final Answer

When you search for a website on your home Wi-Fi:

1. Your browser generates an HTTP request at the **Application Layer**.
2. The request is encrypted and formatted at the **Presentation Layer**.
3. A session is established at the **Session Layer**.
4. The data is divided into TCP segments at the **Transport Layer**.
5. The segments are wrapped in IP packets at the **Network Layer**.
6. The packets are encapsulated in Wi-Fi frames at the **Data Link Layer**.
7. The frames are converted into **radio waves** at the **Physical Layer** and transmitted to your router.

Your router receives the radio waves, processes the data, and forwards it to the next node (e.g., your ISP). The data travels through the internet in various physical forms (electrical signals, light pulses, radio waves) until it reaches the web server. The server responds, and the website data travels back to your device in the same layered manner.
