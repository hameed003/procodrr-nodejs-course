No, you **cannot say that your laptop cannot perform the Network Layer**. In fact, your laptop **can and does perform all 7 layers of the OSI model**, including the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**. Let me explain why and how your laptop handles each layer, including the Network Layer.

### Why Your Laptop Performs All 7 Layers

Your laptop is a **complete end device** in the network communication process, meaning it handles all layers of the OSI model when sending or receiving data. Here's how it works:

---

#### **Layer 1: Physical Layer**

- **Function**: Converts digital data into **electrical signals** (for wired connections) or **radio waves** (for wireless connections).
- **Example**: Your laptop’s Wi-Fi adapter converts data into radio waves for transmission.

---

#### **Layer 2: Data Link Layer**

- **Function**: Encapsulates data into **frames** and adds MAC addresses for local network communication.
- **Example**: Your laptop adds its MAC address and the router’s MAC address to outgoing data.

---

#### **Layer 3: Network Layer**

- **Function**: Adds **IP addresses** to packets and routes them to the correct destination.
- **Example**: Your laptop adds its IP address and the destination server’s IP address to outgoing packets.
- **Key Point**: Your laptop **does perform the Network Layer** because it:
  - Assigns source and destination IP addresses to packets.
  - Uses the **routing table** to determine where to send packets (e.g., to the default gateway, which is your router).

---

#### **Layer 4: Transport Layer**

- **Function**: Breaks data into **segments** and ensures reliable delivery using **TCP** or fast delivery using **UDP**.
- **Example**: When you browse a website, TCP ensures the data is delivered reliably.

---

#### **Layer 5: Session Layer**

- **Function**: Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions between applications.
- **Example**: When you use a web browser, it establishes a session with the web server using protocols like **TLS/SSL**.

---

#### **Layer 6: Presentation Layer**

- **Function**: Encrypts, compresses, or formats data for transmission.
- **Example**: Your browser encrypts data using **SSL/TLS** for secure communication (HTTPS).

---

#### **Layer 7: Application Layer**

- **Function**: Generates user data and interacts with the network.
- **Example**: Your browser generates an HTTP request to fetch a website.

### Key Clarifications

1. **Your Laptop Handles the Network Layer**:

   - Your laptop assigns **source and destination IP addresses** to packets.
   - It uses its **routing table** to determine where to send packets (e.g., to the default gateway, which is your router).
   - Without the Network Layer, your laptop wouldn’t know how to route packets to the correct destination.

2. **Your Laptop Works with Other Devices**:

   - While your laptop performs all 7 layers, it relies on other devices (e.g., routers, switches) to forward packets across the internet.
   - For example, your laptop sends packets to the router, which then routes them to the next hop.

3. **Routers vs. Laptops**:
   - Routers primarily focus on **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** and **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**.
   - Laptops, as end devices, handle **all 7 layers** because they generate, process, and consume data.

### Example: Browsing a Website on Your Laptop

1. **Application Layer**: Your browser generates an HTTP request.
2. **Presentation Layer**: The request is encrypted using SSL/TLS.
3. **Session Layer**: A secure session is established with the web server.
4. **Transport Layer**: The data is broken into TCP segments.
5. **Network Layer**: IP addresses are added to the packets, and your laptop determines the next hop (e.g., your router).
6. **Data Link Layer**: MAC addresses are added, and the data is encapsulated in frames.
7. **Physical Layer**: The frames are converted into radio waves (Wi-Fi) or electrical signals (Ethernet) and transmitted.

### Can You Say Your Laptop Cannot Perform the Network Layer?

No, you **cannot say that your laptop cannot perform the Network Layer**. Your laptop **does perform the Network Layer** by:

- Assigning IP addresses to packets.
- Using its routing table to determine where to send packets (e.g., to the default gateway).

However, your laptop relies on other devices (e.g., routers) to forward packets across the internet. The router’s primary role is to route packets between networks, but your laptop still handles the Network Layer for its own communication.

---

### Final Answer

Your laptop **can and does perform all 7 layers of the OSI model**, including the **Network Layer (Layer 3)**. It assigns IP addresses to packets, uses its routing table to determine the next hop, and sends packets to the router for further forwarding. While routers specialize in Layer 3 routing, your laptop handles all layers to generate, process, and consume data. Therefore, you **cannot say that your laptop cannot perform the Network Layer**.
