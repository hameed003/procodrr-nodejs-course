In Windows, you can read or view the contents of a file using the Command Prompt (CMD) with commands like `type`, `more`, and `find`. Below is a detailed explanation of these commands with examples:

---

### **1. Read File Content Using `type` Command**

The `type` command is the most common way to display the contents of a file in the Command Prompt.

#### **Syntax**

```

     ```

2. **Display the Contents of a File with Spaces in the Name**:

   - Display the contents of a file named `My Document.txt`:
     ```
     type "My Document.txt"
     ```

3. **Display the Contents of Multiple Files**:
   - Display the contents of two files named `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`:
     ```
     type file1.txt file2.txt
     ```

---

### **2. Read File Content Using `more` Command**

The `more` command is used to display the contents of a file one screen at a time. It is useful for large files.

#### **Syntax**

```
more [filename]
```

---

#### **Examples of `more`**

1. **Display the Contents of a File Page by Page**:

   - Display the contents of a file named `largeFile.txt` one screen at a time:
     ```

     ```
   - Press `Enter` to scroll line by line or `Spacebar` to scroll page by page.

2. **Display the Contents of a File with Spaces in the Name**:

     ```
     more "My Document.txt"
     ```

3. **Display the Contents of Multiple Files**:

     ```
     more file1.txt file2.txt
     ```

### **3. Search for Specific Content Using `find` Command**

The `find` command is used to search for specific text within a file.

#### **Syntax**

```
find "search_string" [filename]
```

---

#### **Examples of `find`**

1. **Search for a Specific String in a File**:

   - Search for the string `Hello` in a file named `myFile.txt`:
     ```
     find "Hello" myFile.txt
     ```

2. **Search for a String in Multiple Files**:

   - Search for the string `World` in two files named `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`:
     ```
     find "World" file1.txt file2.txt
     ```

3. **Case-Insensitive Search**:

   - Perform a case-insensitive search for the string `hello` in a file named `myFile.txt`:
     ```
     find /i "hello" myFile.txt
     ```

4. **Display Line Numbers**:
   - Display line numbers along with the search results for the string `Hello` in a file named `myFile.txt`:
     ```
     find /n "Hello" myFile.txt
     ```

---

### **4. Read File Content Using `for` Command**

The `for` command can be used to read and process the contents of a file line by line.

#### **Syntax**

```
for /f "delims=" %i in ([filename]) do @echo %i
```

---

#### **Examples of `for`**

1. **Display Each Line of a File**:

   - Display each line of a file named `myFile.txt`:
     ```
     for /f "delims=" %i in (myFile.txt) do @echo %i
     ```

2. **Display Each Line of a File with Spaces in the Name**:
   - Display each line of a file named `My Document.txt`:
     ```
     for /f "delims=" %i in ("My Document.txt") do @echo %i
     ```

### **Common Errors and Solutions**

1. **File Not Found**:

   - Ensure the file name and path are correct.
   - Example:
     ```
     type nonExistentFile.txt
     ```
     Error: `The system cannot find the file specified.`

2. **Permission Denied**:

   - Ensure you have read permissions for the file.
   - Example:
     ```
     type C:\Windows\system32\config\SAM
     ```
     Error: `Access is denied.`

3. **Invalid File Name**:
   - Ensure the file name does not contain invalid characters (`\`, `/`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`).
   - Example:
     ```
     type invalid/file.txt
     ```
     Error: `The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.`
