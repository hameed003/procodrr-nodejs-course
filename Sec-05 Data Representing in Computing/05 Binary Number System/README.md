The **binary number system**, also known as the **base-2 number system**, is a positional numeral system that uses only two digits: **0 and 1**. It is the foundation of all modern computing and digital systems because it directly represents the on (1) and off (0) states of electronic components.

### Key Features of the Binary Number System:

1. **Base-2 System**: Each digit represents a power of 2.
2. **Digits**: Only digits 0 and 1 are used.
3. **Positional Value**: The value of each digit is determined by its position, starting from the right (least significant digit) to the left (most significant digit).
4. **Fundamental to Computing**: Binary is the language of computers, as it aligns with the physical states of transistors and memory cells.

### How the Binary System Works:

In the binary system, each digit represents a power of 2. The rightmost digit is $2^0$, the next digit to the left is $2^1$, then $2^2$, and so on.

For example:

- The binary number $1011\_{2}$ can be expanded as:

$$
1 \times 2^3 + 0 \times 2^2 + 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0
$$

$$
= 1 \times 8 + 0 \times 4 + 1 \times 2 + 1 \times 1
$$

$$
= 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11\_{10}
$$

So, $1011\_{2}$ in binary is equal to $11\_{10}$ in decimal.

### Examples of Binary Numbers:

1. $1\_{2}$

$$
1 \times 2^0 = 1\_{10}
$$

2. $10\_{2}$

$$
1 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 2 + 0 = 2\_{10}
$$

3. $101\_{2}$

$$
1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5\_{10}
$$

4. $1100\_{2}$

$$
1 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 0 \times 2^0 = 8 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 12\_{10}
$$

### Conversion Between Binary and Other Number Systems:

#### 1. **Binary to Decimal**:

Multiply each binary digit by its corresponding power of 2 and sum the results.

Example: Convert $1101\_{2}$ to decimal.

$$
1 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0
$$

$$
= 1 \times 8 + 1 \times 4 + 0 \times 2 + 1 \times 1
$$

$$
= 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13\_{10}
$$

#### 2. **Decimal to Binary**:

Divide the decimal number by 2 repeatedly and record the remainders.

Example: Convert $25\_{10}$ to binary.

$$
25 \div 2 = 12 \quad \text{remainder } 1
$$

$$
12 \div 2 = 6 \quad \text{remainder } 0
$$

$$
6 \div 2 = 3 \quad \text{remainder } 0
$$

$$
3 \div 2 = 1 \quad \text{remainder } 1
$$

$$
1 \div 2 = 0 \quad \text{remainder } 1
$$

Read the remainders in reverse order: $11001_2$.

#### 3. **Binary to Octal**:

Group binary digits into sets of 3 (starting from the right) and convert each group to its octal equivalent.

Example: Convert $110101_2$ to octal.

$$
110_2 = 6_8, \quad 101_2 = 5_8
$$

Combine the octal digits: $65_8$.

#### 4. **Octal to Binary**:

Each octal digit corresponds to exactly 3 binary digits.

Example: Convert $52_8$ to binary.

$$
5_8 = 101_2, \quad 2_8 = 010_2
$$

Combine the binary digits: $101010_2$.

#### 5. **Binary to Hexadecimal**:

Group binary digits into sets of 4 (starting from the right) and convert each group to its hexadecimal equivalent.

Example: Convert $11010110\_{2}$ to hexadecimal.

$$
1101_2 = D\_{16}, \quad 0110\_{2} = 6\_{16}
$$

Combine the hexadecimal digits: $D6\_{16}$.

#### 6. **Hexadecimal to Binary**:

Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to exactly 4 binary digits.

Example: Convert $A5\_{16}$ to binary.

$$
A\_{16} = 1010\_{2}, \quad 5\_{16} = 0101_2
$$

Combine the binary digits: $10100101_2$.

### Applications of the Binary System:

1. **Computing**: Binary is the foundation of all digital systems, including CPUs, memory, and storage.
2. **Data Representation**: Used to encode text, images, audio, and video in digital formats.
3. **Networking**: Binary data is transmitted over networks in the form of bits.
4. **Cryptography**: Binary operations are used in encryption and decryption algorithms.

### Advantages of the Binary System:

1. **Simplicity**: Only two digits (0 and 1) make it easy to implement in hardware.
2. **Reliability**: Binary states (on/off) are less prone to errors in electronic systems.
3. **Universality**: Binary is the standard for all digital computing systems.

### Summary:

The binary number system is a base-2 system that uses digits 0 and 1. It is the foundation of all modern computing and digital systems. Conversions between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal systems are essential for understanding and working with digital data.
